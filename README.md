# Chat app

## About:
The Rick and Morty Chat app is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to search through a database of Rick and Morty characters, authenticate to access personalized features, send messages to their favorite characters and receive responses from those characters. Creating this project improved my skills in effective consumption of REST APIs to fetch and display dynamic content from the Rick and Morty API. Managing chat data and user sessions enhanced my experience with Supabase features. Creating design with Shadcn improved my skills in using third party design system by finding it limits and how to adjust external library to my use cases.
